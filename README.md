# Run The World
My entry for the Ludum Dare Jam 38.
A faux-3D racing game, in the same spirit as Rad Racer for the NES, written in C++14 over a weekend.
I had no prior experience with such game - and it shows. Still, I'm quite proud of what I was able to achieve.

Known to compile and run well under Linux and OSX. Will probably work well on Windows as well.
Works on Emscripten, but somehow the fonts don't seem to load.
