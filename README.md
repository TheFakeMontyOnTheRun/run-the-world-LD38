# I-maed-this-gaem
This was inspired by the challenge in the 100th one-hour-gamejam. It's a remake of the very first game I ever wrote, "jogando dados com Duke Nukem" (could be translated as "playing dice with Duke Nukem"), back when I was 11, in the mid-90s.

The game is very simple - and that's to be expected, considering that I wrote it in one hour, while waiting for an appointment, at a caf√© in Cascais, Lisbon.
